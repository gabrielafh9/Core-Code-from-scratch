# HTTP Learning Exercise

## Description

Before you can start building Web applications that implement the client-server model, it's important that you know, understand, and can explain why HTTP is such a fundamental technology for the Web.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

#### 1. What is HTTP?
       
       HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a networking protocol used for transferring data between a client, 
       such as a web browser, and a server. It defines how messages are formatted, transmitted, and how web browsers 
       and web servers should respond to requests.

#### 2. What is a Communication Protocol?

     A communication protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern the transmission of data between two or more devices.
     It defines how communication is established, utilized, and how data is packaged, transmitted, and received.
     Examples of protocols include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and IMAP.

      - Do humans use communication protocols?
   
        Yes, humans use a variety of communication protocols in their day-to-day lives. Some examples include verbal communication, 
        body language, eye contact, non-verbal cues, facial expressions, and gestures.

   
#### 3. What is a Request in HTTP?

     A request in HTTP is a type of message sent from a web browser to a web server in order to obtain a specific resource. 
     The resource can be a web page, an image, a file or some other type of data. It is sent in the form of an HTTP header, 
     which contains various pieces of information such as the URL of the requested resource, any parameters that need to be 
     included and the type of HTTP request being made.


#### 4. What is a Response in HTTP?
     
     A response in HTTP is a message sent from a server to a client in response to a request for information. 
     It contains a status code, which tells the client whether a request was successful, as well as additional 
     information about the request. The response also includes a headers section, which contains additional information
     about the data being sent back to the client. The response also includes an optional body section, which contains
     the actual data requested by the client.
