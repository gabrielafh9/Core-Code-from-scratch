# Client-Server Model

### Description

Having a solid understanding of how the communication between a client and server is carried out will give you greater visibility of how the web currently works.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

#### 1. What is a Server?
    
    A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, 
    also known as the client.
    
#### 2. What is a Client?
    The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. 
    
#### 3. Is a server just another physical computer?
    
    A server can be a physical machine, a virtual machine or even a software performing server services. 
    So the way a server functions depends on how the word server is used in a context.
    
     - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
     - What is the difference?
     
       En primer lugar, los servidores de aplicaciones conectan la informaci√≥n de la base de datos 
       (generalmente proveniente de un servidor de base de datos) y el programa cliente o 
       usuario final (que a menudo se ejecuta en un navegador web).
       
#### 4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?
      
      - List some examples
     
      Yes, there is a similarity between human communication and the client-server model. In both scenarios, 
      communication is based on a request and response process. In the client-server model, the client sends
      a request to the server and the server then sends a response back to the client. Similarly, in human 
      communication, one person sends a request and the other person responds to the request.

      
#### 5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
     
     No, the client-server model is not only applicable to the web. It is a distributed application structure that divides 
     processing logic between a client, which requests services, and a server, which provides those services. Client-server
     architecture can be used in many types of applications, such as networked file systems, email systems, and distributed 
     databases. It is also used to structure a variety of mobile applications, video games, and peer-to-peer systems.
        
        
        - Do desktop applications use the client-server model?
     
         Yes, many desktop applications use the client-server model. In this model, 
         the desktop application acts as a client, connecting to a remote server over the internet. 
         The server responds to requests made by the client application and sends back the requested data or information.

        - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?
