# APIs Core Understanding

## Description

We are sure you've heard the word API many times before, but
do you know what an API is?

Knowing what an API really is will help you understand how important
structured communication between two different programs is and what
options currently exist to achieve such communication.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

#### 1. What is an API?
     
     API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of programming protocols and routines for building 
     software applications. It provides developers with a way to access application data and services to interact with 
     other applications, websites, and systems. An API can provide data from a third-party application, define different 
     types of operations that can be performed with the data, and provide control over how the data is accessed and used.

#### 2. What is a Protocol?

     A protocol is a set of rules that govern how two or more computing devices communicate with each other. 
     These rules define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control of data transmission, as well as the methods used
     for detecting and recovering from errors. Protocols often specify the type of data that can be exchanged, how data is packaged,
     and how data is acknowledged from one device to another.


#### 3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?
     
     No, the term API is not only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet. It can also refer to the 
     Application Programming Interface, which is a set of specific rules and guidelines that a program can use to interact with an 
     operating system, software library, or other kind of application. An API could facilitate communication between two different 
     applications or between a client and a server, even if they are not connected via the Internet.


#### 4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?
       
      Structured communication between two programs is important because it helps both programs understand each other and how 
      they need to interact. In most cases, both programs need to agree on a data format to exchange information, and it is important 
      that the format is clear and consistent. Structured communication also helps both programs communicate messages, commands, 
      and data in an efficient manner and allows them to interact in a clear, organized, and predictable way.

      - Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?
      
        No, humans do not typically use APIs when communicating without technology.

   
#### 5. Is an API just another program or a standard?

#### 6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?
