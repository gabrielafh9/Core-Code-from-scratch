# Pseudocode 

## Logic problem

#### Description 

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

#### Solution:

```
Alice says nobody studied math yesterday. It makes no sense because she won't accept that she has not studied.

Eva says "4 people studied mathematics yesterday". Only the ones who studied are telling the truth. 
If 4 of her classmates studied, they shouldn't be lying but they contradict each other. 

If Dan tells the truth, he's contradicting his classmates, and the same logic applies to Charlie.

Therefore, Bob is telling the truth because he's not contradicting anyone and he's the one who studied math.
